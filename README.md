## This project is to display customer's recent transactions with summarized total, total points earned per month.

```
The homework assignment listed below, completed using JavaScript, React, REST (if you have that experience), etc. to really express your skills:
 -> A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction 
    (e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
 -> Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.
 -> Make up a data set to best demonstrate your solution
 -> Check solution into GitHub, and send me a link to your project repo
```
